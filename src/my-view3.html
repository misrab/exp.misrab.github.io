        <p>
          This was an online educational platform I built with three friends.
          It allowed users to create little multimedia slideshows called
          "neurons" that would naturally connect to each other!

          Machine Learning
        </a>
        <p>
          Three classmates and I built systems to recognise spoken language,
          including a Support Vector Machine, Mixtures of Gaussians and an
          Artificial Neural Network. We were able to distinguish languages
          with pretty high accuracy!

          Auction Design
        </a>
        <p>
          Automated, extremely high-frequency auctions are prevalent on the web
          today. Here I analyze exchanges in online advertising, and the
          incentives that affect bidding mechanisms.
