# Revealed Preference

_Posted on January 29th, 2016_



Decision making can be tricky, and nowhere is it trickier than in deciding what to do with one's life. The challenge increases with privilege; for it is indeed privilege to have options in the first place.

Often a decision is portrayed when there really isn't one being made. Ben Horowitz, of VC firm Andreessen Horowitz, [articulates this very well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2e3RqL4VWs). This usually takes the form of "do we want good X or great X?". The question is tautological.

True decision making arises from alternatives with tradeoffs. And yet herein lies my main point for this post: we seem to seldom use the mental tool of tradeoffs when making decisions.

For example, as I write this post I'm occasionally gazing outside and wondering how nice it would be to pursue a life of learning and exploration, as opposed to trading my time for renumeration. For a while I was caught in this mental trap: obviously that seems splendid. But my true preference, call it ["revealed preference"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revealed_preference), becomes much clearer when presented as a choice between alternatives, where good and bad consequences are seriously considered. You can further enhance this by considering multi-step consequences, or indirect consequences as things interact, much like a chess player.

If you ask me if I want ice cream, of course I'll say yes. Now, ask me if I want ice cream _or_ a steak, and right now I'd probably tell you I'm in the mood for a steak. Turns out I didn't want that ice cream as much as I thought. I truly love learning. The thought of owning my time sounds amazing. But would I want to do pure academics and nothing else for a decade? Not me, the FOMO (fear of missing out) is terrifying. That doesn't mean I don't still want to own my time. But it suggests a different, more calculated approach.

The next time you question whether you want something, frame it as a choice against other things. Your priorities will become very clear, your preferences...revealed.
